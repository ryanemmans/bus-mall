# **LAB - BusMall**

## ***Problem Domain***

You’ve been hired by a startup called BusMall, who wants to feature only the items in its catalog that are the most likely to sell.

BusMall wants to do market analysis on proposed products to test their potential customer interest.

The app’s purpose is to have the group members choose which product, of the three displayed images, that they would be most likely to purchase, and then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data.

Results will be shown to users once there have been a total of 25 selections made.

You’ll also need to keep track of how many times each image is displayed.
